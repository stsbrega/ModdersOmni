# Fallout 4 Modding Knowledge

<version_management>

## OG vs Next-Gen Version Matrix

Community consensus: stay on pre-next-gen version 1.10.163. The April 2024 Next-Gen Update broke F4SE and most DLL mods.

| Component | OG (1.10.163) | Next-Gen |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| F4SE | v0.6.23 | NG-specific builds (limited) |
| Buffout 4 | Classic Buffout 4 | Buffout 4 NG (#64880) |
| Address Library | OG version | NG version |
| UFO4P | v2.2.0a (requires all DLCs) | Latest NG-compatible |
| PRP | Version matched to build | Version matched to build |

<precombines>

## Precombines and Previs — CRITICAL FO4 Knowledge

This is the MOST IMPORTANT methodological difference between Skyrim and Fallout 4 modding. No equivalent system exists in Skyrim.

**PRECOMBINES** merge multiple static meshes into single draw calls. **PREVIS** is precomputed occlusion data telling the engine to skip hidden objects.

ANY modification to an existing placed object in a precombined mesh — moving, deleting, disabling, resizing, or changing properties — breaks ALL precombines in that cell. A single broken precombine disables previs for a 3x3 cell area (9 cells). FPS drops from 60+ to single digits in dense areas like downtown Boston.

Adding NEW objects (not in vanilla) does NOT break precombines. Only modifications to existing placed objects trigger breakage.

**PRP** (Previsibines Repair Pack, #46403) rebuilds precombines/previs for all vanilla cells. PRP cell header records must ALWAYS win conflicts — its records must load last. Non-negotiable.

PRP cannot repair breakage caused by third-party mods editing vanilla placed objects.

</precombines>

<phase_1_essentials>

## Phase 1: Essential Engine Stack

Target pre-NG version 1.10.163. Select in this dependency order:

1. **F4SE** (f4se.silverlock.org) — v0.6.23 for OG. Installs to game root.
2. **Address Library for F4SE** (#47327) — Match to game version.
3. **xSE PluginPreloader F4** — REQUIRED by Buffout 4 (will not function without it).
4. **Buffout 4 NG** (#64880) — Crash logger + 15+ engine fixes. Replaces standalone Achievements Mod, Auto Gamepad Switch, Faster Workshop.
5. **High FPS Physics Fix** — CRITICAL: physics break above 60 FPS without this.
6. **UFO4P** — v2.2.0a; requires all DLCs.
7. **Previsibines Repair Pack** (#46403) — Rebuilt precombines/previs. See `<precombines>` for conflict rules.
8. **MCM** (#21497) + **MCM Booster** (#56997).
9. **X-Cell** (#84214) — Performance/threading improvements. Separate OG and NG installs.
10. **Weapon Debris Crash Fix** (#48078) — Fixes FleX crash on Nvidia 16/20/30/40 series.
11. **Sprint Stuttering Fix** (#47760) — Camera stutter on uneven terrain.
12. **Mentats - F4SE** (#91565) — Engine-level fix collection.

<fo4_specific_methodology>

## FO4-Specific Technical Details

**AWKCR is deprecated.** Use **ECO Redux** (#55503). Legacy AWKCR-dependent mods can use "Grilled Cheese" or "AWKCR-R" as lightweight shims.

**BA2 archive rules:** FO4 loads up to 4 BA2s per plugin with MANDATORY suffixes:
- `PluginName - Main.ba2`
- `PluginName - Textures.ba2`
- `PluginName - Voices_en.ba2`
- `PluginName - Voices_XX.ba2`
FO4 will NOT load archives without these exact naming conventions (including spaces around hyphen).

**BA2 archive limit:** ~256 non-texture BA2s. Often constrains large modlists before the 254 plugin limit. Monitor count when building large lists.

**Loose files vs BA2:** Loose files cause significantly more stutter in FO4 than Skyrim. Always prefer BA2-packed versions.

**OMOD/ModCol system:** Object Modifications use fixed slots per weapon/armor. Multiple mods editing the same weapon's OMODs will conflict — only last-loaded changes persist. No automatic merging. Requires manual xEdit patches to combine.

<load_order_categories>

## Fallout 4 Load Order Category Sequence

1. Masters and base game ESMs
2. Unofficial Patches (UFO4P)
3. Frameworks and resource libraries (ECO Redux, keyword frameworks)
4. Bug fixes and engine patches
5. UI and HUD (DEF_UI/FallUI, Full Dialogue Interface, HUDFramework)
6. Gameplay overhauls (combat, loot, economy)
7. New content (quests, factions, companions, worldspaces)
8. Weapons and armor (new gear, retextures, OMOD mods)
9. NPC and AI modifications
10. Visuals and textures
11. Settlement mods (ONLY mods adding new objects — never precombine-breaking scrap mods)
12. Conflict resolution patches (Bashed Patch, Synthesis, manual CR)
13. **Previs patches — MUST load last (see `<precombines>` rules)**

</load_order_categories>

<conflict_patterns_fo4>

## FO4-Specific Conflict Patterns

**PRECOMBINE/PRP CONFLICTS** — See `<precombines>` for full rules. Any mod loading cell headers after PRP invalidates precombine/previs data.

**OMOD/MODCOL CONFLICTS** — Multiple mods modifying same weapon's Object Modifications conflict on fixed slots. No merge possible — requires manual xEdit patching.

**BA2 ARCHIVE LIMIT** — ~256 non-texture BA2s. Exceeding causes silent asset loading failures.

</conflict_patterns_fo4>

<fo4_prohibitions>

## FO4-Specific Prohibitions

NEVER select "Scrap Everything" or similar precombine-disabling mods — see `<precombines>`.

NEVER select AWKCR — deprecated, bloated, crash-prone. Use ECO Redux.

NEVER select mods that modify vanilla placed objects unless they explicitly regenerate precombines.

Do NOT mix OG and Next-Gen versions of framework mods.
