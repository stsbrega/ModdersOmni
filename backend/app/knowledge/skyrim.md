# Skyrim SE/AE Modding Knowledge

<version_management>

## SE vs AE Version Matrix

| Component | SE 1.5.97 | AE 1.6.1170 | BoBW |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|
| SKSE | v2.0.20 | v2.2.6 | v2.0.20 |
| Address Library | SE-specific download | All-in-One AE V11 | SE-specific download |
| Crash Logger | .NET Script Framework (#21294) | Crash Logger SSE (#59818) | .NET Script Framework |
| USSEP | v4.2.5b (last SE version) | v4.3.x (requires CC masters) | v4.2.5b |
| ESL Record Cap | 2048 (without BEES) | 4096 | 4096 (with BEES) |

Address Library SE and AE packages are NOT interchangeable — memory offset IDs differ between executables. Wrong version causes all SKSE plugins to fail.

BoBW downgrades EXE/DLLs to 1.5.97 while keeping AE content. Requires BEES (Backported Extended ESL Support) and SE Address Library.

<phase_1_essentials>

## Phase 1: Essential Engine Stack

Select in this dependency order. Each mod may depend on those above it:

1. **SKSE64** (#30379) — Installs to game root, NOT through MO2. v2.0.20 for SE; v2.2.6 for AE.
2. **Address Library** (#32444) — SE and AE are SEPARATE downloads.
3. **SSE Engine Fixes** (#17230) — Two-part: Part 1 via MO2, Part 2 (d3dx9_42.dll) to game root. Fixes file handle limit, tree LOD, save corruption.
4. **USSEP** (#266) — v4.2.5b for SE; v4.3.x for AE (requires CC masters).
5. **Bug Fixes SSE** (#33261) — Separate downloads for SE and AE.
6. **Scrambled Bugs** (#43532) — Configurable fixes via TOML config.
7. **po3's Tweaks** (#51073) — Required by Papyrus Extender.
8. **SkyUI** (#12604) — MCM framework. Works on all versions.
9. **SSE Display Tweaks** (#34705) — Frame limiter, physics fix. FPS cap = refresh rate minus 1.
10. **Crash Logger** — #59818 for AE; .NET Script Framework (#21294) for SE.
11. **po3's Papyrus Extender** (#22854) — 374+ new Papyrus functions.
12. **MCM Helper** (#53000) — Persistent MCM settings. Replaces FISSES.
13. **ConsoleUtilSSE NG** (#76649) — Works across all SE/AE versions.
14. **PapyrusUtil SE** (#13048) — Widely depended-upon scripting utilities.
15. **JContainers SE** (#16495) — Complex data structures for Papyrus.
16. **More Informative Console** (#19250) — Essential for debugging.

<animation_framework>

## Phase 6: Animation and Skeleton (Skyrim-Specific)

**XPMSSE** is the standard skeleton framework. Nearly all animation mods require it. Only one skeleton mod should be active.

**Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine** (#60033) generates behavior files. Output must be regenerated after adding/removing any animation mod — missing output causes crashes on character load. Nemesis generates a dummy FNIS.esp for backward compatibility — do not remove it.

**FNIS** is only needed for creature animation mods Nemesis doesn't support.

**OAR** (Open Animation Replacer) is the actively maintained successor to **DAR**. Both allow condition-based animation swaps without Nemesis patches. OAR has better performance and more conditions.

</animation_framework>

<weather_lighting>

## Phase 12: Weather and Lighting (Skyrim-Specific)

Weather overhauls are mutually exclusive — select exactly ONE (Cathedral Weathers, Obsidian Weathers, NAT, Azurite, etc.).

ENB presets are designed for specific weather mods — verify compatibility before pairing.

Community Shaders and ENB are mutually exclusive:
- ENB: Best quality, highest performance cost. Requires matched weather mod.
- Community Shaders: Open-source, lighter. No weather-specific tuning needed.
- ReShade: Post-processing only. Compatible with Community Shaders but not ENB.

**Lux** (interior lighting) and **Window Shadows** are compatible and commonly paired.

<load_order_categories>

## Load Order Category Sequence (22 Categories)

Both left-pane and right-pane should follow this sequence:

1. Utilities and tools (SKSE, ENB binaries, Root Builder)
2. Bug fixes and engine patches (USSEP, SSE Engine Fixes, Scrambled Bugs)
3. Extension frameworks (Address Library, Papyrus Extender, SPID, KID)
4. Resource libraries (shared asset packs)
5. UI and HUD (SkyUI, TrueHUD, iHUD, MCM Helper)
6. Quality of life (display tweaks, hotkeys)
7. Meshes/textures — architecture and landscape (SMIM, Skyrim 2020, Skyland)
8. Meshes/textures — clutter and items
9. Weather and lighting (Cathedral, Lux, ELFX, Window Shadows)
10. Landscape and environment (grass, flora, terrain, water, trees)
11. Cities and towns (JK's Skyrim, city overhauls)
12. Gameplay overhauls (perks, combat, magic, economy)
13. NPC appearance and AI (NPC replacers, AI Overhaul)
14. Body, skin, and hair (CBBE/BHUNP/HIMBO, skin textures)
15. Creatures and enemies (retextures, new enemies, spawns)
16. Items, weapons, and armor (new gear, distribution mods)
17. Quests and new lands (quest mods, worldspaces, followers)
18. Audio and music
19. Animations (movement, combat, idle)
20. Late loaders and compatibility patches
21. Generated output (Bashed Patch, Synthesis, Nemesis, DynDOLOD, Occlusion)
22. ENB/ReShade/Community Shaders

Rules: Patches after mods they patch. Bashed Patch near end. Synthesis after Bashed Patch. DynDOLOD.esm as last ESM; DynDOLOD.esp and Occlusion.esp at very end.

<conflict_patterns_skyrim>

## Skyrim-Specific Conflict Patterns

**NPC DARK FACE BUG** — Plugin controlling NPC appearance (right pane) doesn't match FaceGen files loaded (left pane). Ensure left-pane asset priority mirrors right-pane plugin order for NPC mods. Face Discoloration Fix (#42441) is a runtime safety net.

</conflict_patterns_skyrim>

<skyrim_prohibitions>

## Skyrim-Specific Prohibitions

Do NOT select ENBoost for SSE — Oldrim-only utility. SSE is 64-bit and does not need it.

Do NOT select multiple skeleton mods — XPMSSE is the standard.
